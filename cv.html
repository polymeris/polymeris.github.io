            <h3>Wivo Dull Boy</h3>
            <p>Clojure, Clojurescript, RabbitMQ, OpenVPN</p>
            <p>IoT data acquisition and aggregation</p>
            <p>
                The distributed and varied nature of Wivo's sensors poses a challenge when it comes to data acquisition.
                The sites vary wildly in infrastructure reliability making it mandatory to design a very robust system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dull Boy was one of the first microservices implemented at Wivo, while getting away from the MVP's
                monolithic model. While its companion service Hannibal handled customer-provided data, and was as such
                a more traditional ETL service, Dull Boy's purpose was to serve as the ingestion point of
                sensor-generated timeseries. The unreliability in site connectivity and power supply made it a necessity
                to design reproducible, idempotent data pipeline, for which Clojure statelessness was very well suited.
            </p>
            <p>
                To decouple spikes in incoming requests, RabbitMQ was used as a loading queue, and to assist in
                customer isolation and security, VPNs where created. The generation of these services was automated
                with Docker and Docker Compose.
            </p>
            <p>
                An operational monitoring UI was also created with ClojureScript. This was later spun-off into its own
                service.

            <p>Flexible business-oriented time-series database</p>
            <p>Clojure, Postgres, ElasticSearch</p>
            <p>
                As a very small startup, every customer was of extreme importance for Wivo. Thus, it was necessary
                to create a flexible platform which could address the particular needs of each one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Existing time-series databases were focused on operational aspects, relegating important factors
                in the retail business, so we implemented our own system based on Postgres and ElasticSearch which
                addressed those requirements.
            </p>
            <p>Postgres serves as the source of truth, while ElasticSearch serves
                as a store for materialized views of each customer's business metrics. The pipeline that renders these
                views is fully configurable, enabling the execution of complex queries involving both data acquired
                from Wivo's on-site sensors and provided by the client.
                The produced reports ultimately allow for actionable insights on the customer's side.

            <p>Python, QGIS</p>

                Implement a QGIS plugin that makes it possible to run the versatile
                "System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis" (SAGA GIS) modules from Quantum GIS.
                Generate a GUI on-the-fly and run the modules using either the SAGA command-line application or the SAGA
                Python API, if available. Automate the process of information exchange between those two systems.
                Incorporate the most used remote sensing, classification & filtering algorithms from the OrfeoToolbox
                into the Sextante framework, using its python bindings. Incorporate multithreading to sextante to
                enable algorithm interruption.
